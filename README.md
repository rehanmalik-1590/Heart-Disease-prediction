# Heart-Disease-prediction

Heart Disease Prediction
This project implements a machine learning model to predict heart disease status based on various health parameters and lifestyle factors.

📋 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can identify individuals at risk of heart disease using a comprehensive dataset containing 21 different health-related features.

🗂️ Dataset Information
The dataset contains 10,000 records with the following features:

Demographic Information:
Age: Patient age (18-80 years)

Gender: Male/Female

Medical History & Conditions:
Blood Pressure: Range 120-180 mmHg

Cholesterol Level: Range 150-300 mg/dL

Diabetes: Yes/No

High Blood Pressure: Yes/No

Family Heart Disease: Yes/No

BMI: Body Mass Index (18-40)

Lifestyle Factors:
Exercise Habits: High/Medium/Low

Smoking: Yes/No

Alcohol Consumption: High/Medium/Low

Stress Level: High/Medium/Low

Sleep Hours: Average hours of sleep

Sugar Consumption: High/Medium/Low

Blood Markers & Lab Results:
Triglyceride Level: 100-400 mg/dL

Fasting Blood Sugar: 80-160 mg/dL

CRP Level: C-reactive protein levels

Homocysteine Level: Homocysteine levels

Low HDL Cholesterol: Yes/No

High LDL Cholesterol: Yes/No

Target Variable:
Heart Disease Status: Yes/No (Prediction target)
